// The owner's read state for imported items (migration 0026): per
// reading row, the highest version read, so a client that marks a post read on
// one device sees it read on the others. Studio-private and numbers only. GET
// /reading carries it as `imported.readVersion`.
//
// Reads are idempotent and monotonic: the stored value is max(existing,
// requested), and `updated` moves only when that value rises, so a replay, a
// reordered queue or a stale client can never lower it. A row is stored only
// for an imported item held here; anything else is acknowledged and ignored.
// Clients read a 404 from these routes as "this server has no read state", so
// an unknown subscription or item must not answer 404.
//
// Clearing ("mark unread", 0026) sets read_version to NULL and records
// unread_at, the server time of the clear: a tombstone. A read that says when
// it happened (`read_at`) and happened before the latest clear is ignored, so
// an offline queue cannot undo a later "mark unread" from another device. A
// read with no read_at applies as it always did. Because a clear resets
// read_version to NULL, the next accepted read stores its own version: max()
// runs against what is held since the clear, never against the pre-clear value.
// unread_at is kept after a read applies, as the row's last-cleared watermark.
//
// Both instants are stored as Date#toISOString (millisecond, UTC, `Z`), so
// comparing them as strings compares them as instants. read_at is normalized
// to that form on the way in; a client's clock skew is the client's to own.
