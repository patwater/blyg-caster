-- The owner's read state for imported items: per reading row, the highest
-- version read. Studio-private and numbers only; no public page, feed, item
-- document, manifest or export reads it. Writes keep the larger value, so a
-- replayed or reordered mark never lowers it (src/importer/read-state.ts).
--
-- Read state can be cleared ("mark unread"). A cleared row keeps its place
-- with read_version NULL and unread_at set to the server time of the clear: a
-- tombstone, so a read a client made before the clear and delivers after it
-- (an offline queue, another device) is ignored rather than resurrecting the
-- mark. unread_at stays after a later read applies, as the row's last-cleared
-- watermark. Both timestamps are written normalized (Date#toISOString), so
-- comparing them as strings compares instants.

  subscription_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  remote_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  read_version INTEGER,
  updated TEXT NOT NULL,

-- No foreign keys, like the rest of the schema: these follow the importer's
